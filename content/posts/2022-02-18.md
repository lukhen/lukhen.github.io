-   jwt secret

<!--more-->


## jwt secret {#jwt-secret}

Now secret is loaded from a separate file.
I have to remember to change it just after I pull the code from github to server.
Maybe I should implement some kind of a guard to check and inform if the secret
has been changed or set.

Or config as the environmest in Reader monad. I think that's always a good idea.
