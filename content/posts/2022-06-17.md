## logging to postgresdb container {#logging-to-postgresdb-container}

docker exec -ti lukhbook-postgresdb-1 /bin/sh
psql -U username -d dbname

added zettel [logging to postgresdb container]({{< relref "20220619085342-logging_to_postgresdb_container.md" >}})


## volume on stage build {#volume-on-stage-build}

should I use volumes on stage build
I think not, but on dev build I don't have postgres to test.


## deno refused connection {#deno-refused-connection}

I get Connection refused (os error 111)
here <https://bytemeta.vip/repo/denodrivers/postgres/issues/377>
they say it's the problem with configuration.

Simply there's nothing that listens.


## localhost vs 127.0.0.1 {#localhost-vs-127-dot-0-dot-0-dot-1}

It started working.
What's the difference?
I thought they're equal.
