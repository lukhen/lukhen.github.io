-   fromAny constructor

<!--more-->


## fromAny constructor {#fromany-constructor}

Unfortunately io-ts hasn't yet been ported to deno,
and I can't easily get rid of 'any' from json().

I came up with something like this:

```emacs-lisp
const fromAny: (o: unknown) => O.Option<User> =
    o => {
	const x = o as User
	if (x.name == undefined) return O.none
	else
	    return O.some(x)
}

Deno.test("adf", () => {
    const x = fromAny({})
    assertEquals(fromAny({name: "lukh"}), O.some({name: "lukh"}))
})
```
