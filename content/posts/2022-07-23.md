-   a lot of type castings

<!--more-->


## a lot of type castings {#a-lot-of-type-castings}

There are a lot of type errors in equality checks.
The dev of this code used assert library with a different equality assertion.
I haven't found an equivalent in deno. But casting this much seems a bad idea.
