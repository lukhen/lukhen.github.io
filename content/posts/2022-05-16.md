## fix links export {#fix-links-export}

ox-hugo had problems with exporting links.
I tried a few solutions:

-   <https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/483#issuecomment-1003301339>
-   (setq org-id-extra-files (find-lisp-find-files org-roam-directory "\\.org$"))

But the problem was somewhere else. I handled it by changing the way of exporting notes.
