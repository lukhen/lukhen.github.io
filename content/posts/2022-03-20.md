## Running haskell file with ghc {#running-haskell-file-with-ghc}

To run a haskell file I had to use
ghc --make -dynamic path/to/file.hs

## Drawing in haskell {#drawing-in-haskell}

Pictures are drawn from the middle - Point 0, 0 is the center of the image
<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gloss-1.13.2.1/docs/Graphics-Gloss-Data-Picture.html>

Maybe I'll try to follow How to Code course with haskell.


## Https only {#https-only}

I made that https only request are heading to backend by blocking backend port 1337 for prod build.
Only request through nginx are possible.
