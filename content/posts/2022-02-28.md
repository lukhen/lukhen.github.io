## github keys {#github-keys}

Pushing to github
I have a problem with grasping how keys are used in github.
What is the difference between gpg keys and ssh keys.
Gpg keys -&gt; signing commits

I've added gpg key to github, then to git (git.user).
But still I couldn't push. Then I realized (read the docs more thoroughly) that
gpg keys are used to sign commits, not to authenticate user, so that he can push.

So I added an ssh key to repo keys, ssh-added in the console, and then I could push.
But still I'm not entirely sure about how should I use both.

edit: Nope, you don't have to add a ssh-key to each repo to be able to push to your own repo


## github keys {#github-keys}

Pulling from github also requires an ssh.
I generated a new one: github. (~/.ssh/github and ~/.ssh/github.pub).
I have to set github.pub in my github account.
