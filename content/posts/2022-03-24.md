-   replication strategy

<!--more-->


## replication strategy {#replication-strategy}

  I thnk I should replicate only tables that I need + those
which relate to them

ex.

User

-   id
-   pass
-   email

Klient:

-   id
-   name

Reservation:

-   id
-   date
-   user_id
-   klient_id

To replicate Reservation I should also replicate User and Klient.
But not all tables that have reservation_id as foreign key.
