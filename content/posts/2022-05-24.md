## shared folder on virtual box {#shared-folder-on-virtual-box}

after 2 hours of struggle
I succeded in setting shared folder

## installed haskell for emacs {#installed-haskell-for-emacs}

Now it would be nice to test as much as possible


## haskell in emacs {#haskell-in-emacs}

I installed
lsp-mode
lsp-haskell
lsp-ui
haskell-mode

I installed ghcup before.
