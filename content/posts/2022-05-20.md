-   publishing
-   insert current filename in emacs
-   list files that were not published

<!--more-->


## publishing {#publishing}

All that have publishdate is published.
Everything else should be tagged private.


## insert current filename {#insert-current-filename}

I used this function:

(defun insert-current-file-name-at-point (&amp;optional full-path)
  "Insert the current filename at point.
With prefix argument, use full path."
  (interactive "P")
  (let\* ((buffer
	  (if (minibufferp)
	      (window-buffer
	       (minibuffer-selected-window))
	    (current-buffer)))
	 (filename (buffer-file-name buffer)))
    (if filename
	(insert (if full-path filename (file-name-nondirectory filename)))
      (error (format "Buffer %s is not visiting a file" (buffer-name buffer))))))


## list files that were not published {#list-files-that-were-not-published}

grep -r -L --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=gtd "^#+hugo_publishdate: [0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]" .
created [zettel]({{< relref "20220522232900-list_roam_files_that_were_not_published_grep.md" >}})
