-   slash at the end of proxy pass in nginx conf file

<!--more-->


## slash at the end of proxy pass in nginx conf file <span class="tag"><span class="blog_potential">blog-potential</span></span> {#slash-at-the-end-of-proxy-pass-in-nginx-conf-file}

Why is this happening.
If there is slash at the end nginx parses proxy_pass differently.
In stage.conf it was ok, I did it a while ago, and forgot to change it in prod.conf.
In the meantime I forgot about the problem (but I think I described it in journal).
