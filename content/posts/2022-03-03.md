-   Strange problem

<!--more-->


## Strange problem {#strange-problem}

I built the project, but the main page doesn't work.
There is a strange error: "Uncaught Syntax Error: Unexpected token '&lt;'"

Many have this problem with react.
On localhost it works, stage build it works.
On server it doesn't.

After some inspection I think there is a problem with linking to script files.
Script files (bundles) seem to have been compiled properly.
Only links look strange.
I change "homepage" to "." in package.json.
