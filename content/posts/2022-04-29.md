## lsp {#lsp}

I installed lsp-mode and lsp-haskell by hand, with package-install
It seems to work,

Though HaskellSay package cannot be found.

commpiled hls from source
<https://haskell-language-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>
ghcup compile hls --help
<https://haskell-language-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/troubleshooting.html#static-binaries>

running hls manually with terminal and source file
stopped building, maybe /tmp folder has insufficiend disk space
increased /tmp space

failed, not enough disk space
