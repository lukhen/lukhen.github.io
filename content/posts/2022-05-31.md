## typescript project as a library {#typescript-project-as-a-library}

I used this tutorial <https://www.tsmean.com/articles/how-to-write-a-typescript-library/>


## install local modules with npm {#install-local-modules-with-npm}

npm create symlink, not a copy


## deno install packages {#deno-install-packages}

they are downloaded to ~/.cache/deno


## play with deno {#play-with-deno}

it looks impresive


## deno {#deno}

I played in Desktop/deno
downloaded the binary
