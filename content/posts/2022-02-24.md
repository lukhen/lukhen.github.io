## Problem with passing cypress test for auth service <span class="tag"><span class="blog_potential">blog-potential</span></span> {#problem-with-passing-cypress-test-for-auth-service}

I took the longest to figure out that the 127.0.0.1 ip, that the server was listening on,
should be 0.0.0.0.

I also had problems with proper cy.request function args, I used them is the wrong order :)


## Existance tests for all services {#existance-tests-for-all-services}

It would be nice to have existance tests for all services in cypress.

reacui -&gt; can send and receive some data
mysqldb -&gt; responds on port, kind of ping,
replicator -&gt; replicates tables, ??
backend -&gt; responds
other api backends -&gt; respond
