-   functor combinators
-   deno version of fpts is outdated

<!--more-->


## functor combinators {#functor-combinators}

While learning HKT, functor instances, etc I discovered functor combinator 'map'.
Looks very powerful.
But for now I don't see the way to easily combine more than 2 functors.


## deno version of fpts is outdated {#deno-version-of-fpts-is-outdated}

map function in Functor module is different from the newest release.
getFunctorcomposition is better, but in latest version is depracated.
