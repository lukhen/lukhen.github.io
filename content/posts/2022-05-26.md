-   private links properties
-   new haskell project in lukhemacs

<!--more-->


## private links properties {#private-links-properties}

I noticed that links to nodes in commented lines are not visible in backlinks.
And it seems reasonable, but for my purpose it's not acceptable.
Links in properties on the other hand are visible and they are still not exported to hugo.
We'll see if it works for me.


## new haskell project in lukhemacs {#new-haskell-project-in-lukhemacs}

Haskell config:

-   install ghcup with with hls ([here](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/)):
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf <https://get-ghcup.haskell.org> | sh

-   mkdir project
-   cabal init  [cabal docs and simple tut](https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/3.6/getting-started.html)
-   cabal install implicit-hie
-   gen-hie &gt; hie.yaml (to make lsp-haskell work)
