-   Haskell's graphics package gloss

<!--more-->


## Haskell's graphics package gloss {#haskell-s-graphics-package-gloss}

I installed gloss with cabal. It seems it works for now.
Now I'm looking for some documentation.
It would be nice to learn haskell by doing some animations or simple games.
Maybe following some part of How to design programms using haskell.
We'll see

Probably I have to modify PATH in .bashrc or ... file to be able to import cabal packages.
