-   temporary switching to lsp-mode for typescript
-   testing request handler

## temporary switching to lsp-mode for typescript {#temporary-switching-to-lsp-mode-for-typescript}

I'm testing lsp-mode.
Deno has lsp built in, so tide doesn't work well with it.


## testing request handler {#testing-request-handler}
