## exporting with tags {#exporting-with-tags}

I managed to set hugo export with tags.
Some tags should be ignored.
I used code snippet from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/8166p9/can_orgexport_or_oxhugo_ignore_some_tags/)


## publish date {#publish-date}

exporting with publish date:
add EXPORT_HUGO_PUBLISHDATE property with file title (for dailies).
Later I resigned from tree exporting, in favor of whole file exporting.
In that case hugo_publishdate should be used.
