-   org capture

<!--more-->


## org capture {#org-capture}

I'm trying to set org-capture. I'm not sure what should be the capture file name.
Date name seems like an overkill.
One single file for all captures seems not enough.

It looks like roam links both ends must be nodes.
org-roam dailies now seems good.
Each capture as a node seems like an overkill.
