-   not all tests pass
-   rewriting tests

<!--more-->


## not all tests pass {#not-all-tests-pass}

Not all tests from Type.ts pass.
I commented out 'partial', 'tuple' and 'lazy'.

lazy is coupled with partial, so maybe it's 'partial' which causes the error.


## rewriting tests {#rewriting-tests}

Rewriting / reading tests is a great way to learn about a library,
and generally to learn how to use different programming concepts.
