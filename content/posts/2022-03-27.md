-   python in lukhbook

<!--more-->


## python in lukhbook {#python-in-lukhbook}

I have to install python virtual env to run replication test.
Maybe when I learn to use nodejs to work with db I can
rewrite the test in cypress.

Maybe I'll exclude python from git (gitignore).
Then it won't be uploaded to droplet.
But then I won;t be able to test production system.
