## bug, no table {#bug-no-table}

I'm implementing sqliteTableschemadiff,
It seems it's gonna act strangely if the compared table exists in one db, and it doesn't in the other.
Then it will return empty diff, which can mean there are no differences.
Huge bug.


## bug {#bug}

Maybe in getColumns typed query I should firstly getTable and
return errors if it doesn't exist.
