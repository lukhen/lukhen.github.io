-   I was trying to optimize picutres size
-   remove mirage
-   upgrading all docker images

<!--more-->


## I was trying to optimize picutres size {#i-was-trying-to-optimize-picutres-size}

Mirage tool is not working
I did full system update
Problems with gpg keys
I should do system update more regularly.
Mirage still not working.
I installed yay, and should remove yaourt.

Remove unnecessary soft from system !!!

I rebuild some python lib, and mirage is now working.


## remove mirage {#remove-mirage}

I should remove mirage because it's on python2.
There is mirage-python3 package to replace it.


## upgrading all docker images {#upgrading-all-docker-images}

Each time I have to manually check if replicator works.
It would be nice to have an automated test.

Log to postgres docker image
log to database with .env credentials
check if datatables are filled with data
