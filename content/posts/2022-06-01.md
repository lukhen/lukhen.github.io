## setting up deno in emacs {#setting-up-deno-in-emacs}

with tide
doesn't work good


## deno config for emacs {#deno-config-for-emacs}

I configured emacs to work with deno. It seems working, but it's a bit strange.
I used some npm package, so I had to use npm, thus package.json and tsconfig.
Deno itself doesn't need these, just emacs and tsserver, for IDE language support.


## testing async with deno {#testing-async-with-deno}

tested some simple async functions with deno.
Looks straightforward and handy.
