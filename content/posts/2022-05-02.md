-   I changed dailies dir
-   change to hugo

<!--more-->


## I changed dailies dir {#i-changed-dailies-dir}

  Now dailies and roam nodes are in the same location.
Reason: links are correct when exported to hugo markdown.


## change to hugo {#change-to-hugo}

I'm switching to hugo.
Reason - there is a better export org -&gt; post tool.
