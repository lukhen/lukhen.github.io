-   type checking in runtime in typescript

<!--more-->


## type checking in runtime in typescript {#type-checking-in-runtime-in-typescript}

It's a long lasting problem.
One good point is that typescript is just a superset and is transpiled to javascript.
So typescript doesn't have a runtime, javascript does.
But on the other hand type guards are in my opinion necessary for the code to be typesafe.

It'd be the best to make io-ts work in deno.
