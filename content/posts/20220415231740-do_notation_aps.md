I like to use "do" notation  with Either/TaskEither monads which I often use.

```typescript
declare const fetchX:
    () => E.Either<Error, number>

declare const fetchY:
    () => E.Either<Error, string>
```

Let's imagine we need both x and y.

```typescript
pipe(
    fetchX,
    fetchY
)
```

is wrong.
Before I learned to use "do" I used to handle this problem like so:

```typescript
pipe(
    [fetchX(), fetchY()] as [E.Either<Error, number>, E.Either<Error, string>],
    (t) => sequenceT(E.either)(...t),   // convert a tuple of eithers to either of tuple
    E.fold(
	error => { }, // in case of error
	([x, y]) => { } // x: number , y: string
    )
)
```

This approach is effective but looks strange, is unreadable.
But with do notation with apS:

```typescript
pipe(
    E.Do,
    E.apS("x", fetchX()),
    E.apS("y", fetchY()),
    E.fold(
	error => { },
	({ x, y }) => { }
    )
)
```

looks cleaner.
