-   getUser as dependency instead of getToken
-   Secure jwt

<!--more-->


## getUser as dependency instead of getToken {#getuser-as-dependency-instead-of-gettoken}

It looks like only getUser should be dependency injected in serve.ts.


## Secure jwt {#secure-jwt}

JWTs are safe as long as the are sent over https.
What if I want to have cli tool that aquires a token. How to send a https request not with browser.
Api should recognize if the request comes through https.
If not it should use srp protocol.
