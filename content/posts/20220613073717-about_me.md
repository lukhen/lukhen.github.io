## Me {#me}

My name is ≈Åukasz.
I'm a longterm web programmer.
After graduation I did a strange thing and I took a non-porgramming job (as a manager in a family company).
That is why I can't show my programming commercial experience.
But code have always flown in my veins, and within years I did a lot of different things.
I'd gladly join a team as a junior.

## Site {#site}

This site is to present myself, my skills, projects that I have worked on, and to share things, if anyone sees them
useful. I'm not a blogger. I'm a notes person. I make notes about almost anything I do. Once a week I review them,
make them more human readable and publish here in posts with date title and notes category.
I also have kind of zettelkasten system with different things I want to remember (I use the combination of org-mode
and roam for this). I publish it here too in zettel category.
