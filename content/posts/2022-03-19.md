-   https request only
-   select count commands

<!--more-->


## https request only <span class="tag"><span class="blog_potential">blog-potential</span></span> {#https-request-only}

By opening 1337 port only for local connections.
Only nginx can request backend.
That seems a good idea.


## select count commans {#select-count-commans}

docker exec lukhbook-mysqldb-1 mysql -utestuser -ptestpass testdb -e "select COUNT(\*) from Rezerwacje;"

docker exec lukhbook-postgresdb-1 psql -U pguser pgdb -c 'select COUNT(\*) from "Rezerwacje"'

why pguser doesn't demand password?
how to prevent mysql from demanding a password
is this password necessary at all?
