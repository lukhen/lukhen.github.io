-   error while building reactui2 after bumping up docker version
-   sparse tree with date
-   org roam search by date

## error while building reactui2 after bumping up docker version {#error-while-building-reactui2-after-bumping-up-docker-version}

python package was missing
Starting from alpine12 python has been removed.
You have to pick python2 or python3.

I bumped up npm packages versions in package.json. There were errors.
After updating package.json, I haven't run npm install, but immediately
went on to building docker image.
But docker uses package-lock.json which hasn't been updated.
npm install seemed to have resolved the problem

Another error.
Attempted import error: 'Switch' is not exported from 'react-router-dom' (imported as 'Switch').
There were changes in react-router-dom package.
Tests (npm t) haven't passed.
After changes from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63124161/attempted-import-error-switch-is-not-exported-from-react-router-dom) they went ok.

Untill another error - setImmediate is not defined
There are some hints [here](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/8558)
importing setImmediate from "timers" module solved the problem. Tests passed.


## sparse tree with date {#sparse-tree-with-date}

C-c / c b

-   search timestamps before date
    -   searching a dated projects/actions/somedays

update: I dropped using sparse tree for date filtering


## org roam search by date {#org-roam-search-by-date}

I want to use org-roam database do find nodes outdated (projects/isolated tasks)
it looks promising
update: I dropped using db when I found org-roam-node-list
