-   "/" at the end of proxy_pass
-   is all under control
-   templates

<!--more-->


## "/" at the end of proxy_pass {#at-the-end-of-proxy-pass}

adding "_" at the end of proxy_pass makes a difference.
I'm not sure, but I think that with "_" it won't pass location path to the backend.


## is all under control {#is-all-under-control}

I should introduce org (roam) templates to feel more control over the whole system.


## templates {#templates}

I'm trying to setup templates.
:target setting doesn't work properly if there exists a node with the same name.
Try :if-new

updated 13.3.2022
you can change template so that everything is added in "if-new" section
but it's not necessary when you use C-c n f (find node) insdead of capturing.
If node is not found, the template pick screen is shown.
