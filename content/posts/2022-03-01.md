## pull lukhbook {#pull-lukhbook}

I added ~/.ssh/github.pub from droplet to github keys.

then on droplet:

eval \`ssh-agent -s\`

-   read this [read this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17846529/could-not-open-a-connection-to-your-authentication-agent)

and ssh-add ~/.ssh/github    //private key

I changed origin in droplet's lukhbook.
But some time ago I changed something in Dockerfile.
Now I have to make sth up to keep this change.

I added
to reactui dockerfile.
Reactui has been removed,  reactui2 is now the main frontend.
I think I should add this line to reacui2 dockerfile.

git remote -v

-   show origin url

git remote set-url origin here-url

-   change origin url

I created zettel: [pushing and pulling to github]({{< relref "20220313103324-pushing_and_pulling_to_github.md" >}})
