I have a problem with grasping how keys are used in github.
What is the difference between gpg keys and ssh keys.
Gpg keys -> signing commits</p><p>I&rsquo;ve added gpg key to github, then to git (git.user).
But still I couldn&rsquo;t push. Then I realized (read the docs more thoroughly) that
gpg keys are used to sign commits, not to authenticate user, so that he can push.</p><p>So I added an ssh key to repo keys, ssh-added in the console, and then I could push.
But still I&rsquo;m not entirely sure about how should I use both.</p><p>edit: Nope, you don&rsquo;t have to add a ssh-key to each repo to be able to push to your own repo</p><h2 id=github-keys>github keys</h2><p>Pulling from github also requires an ssh.
I generated a new one: github. (~/.ssh/github and ~/.ssh/github.pub).
I have to set github.pub in my github account.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://lukhen.com/>&copy; lukhen 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
