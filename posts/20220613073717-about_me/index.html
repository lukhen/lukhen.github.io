I&rsquo;m a longterm web programmer.
After graduation I did a strange thing and I took a non-porgramming job (as a manager in a family company).
That is why I can&rsquo;t show my programming commercial experience.
But code have always flown in my veins, and within years I did a lot of different things.
I&rsquo;d gladly join a team as a junior.</p><p>This site is to present myself, my skills, projects that I have worked on, and to share things, if anyone sees them
useful. I&rsquo;m not a blogger. I&rsquo;m a notes person. I make notes about almost anything I do. Once a week I review them,
make them more human readable and publish here in posts with date title and notes category.
I also have kind of zettelkasten system with different things I want to remember (I use the combination of org-mode
and roam for this). I publish it here too in zettel category.</p><h2 id=my-skills>My skills:</h2><ul><li>tdd</li><li>functional programming</li><li>object oriented programming</li></ul><h2 id=programming-languages>Programming languages:</h2><ul><li>typescript</li><li>python</li><li>javascript</li><li>racket</li><li>c++ (long ago)</li><li>c# (long ago)</li><li>haskell (very little)</li></ul><h2 id=technologies-frameworks-i-have-worked-with>Technologies/frameworks I have worked with:</h2><ul><li>nodejs</li><li>deno</li><li>react</li><li>docker</li><li>linux</li><li>nginx</li><li>python web frameworks:<ul><li>pyramid</li><li>flask</li></ul></li><li>emacs (my IDE)</li></ul><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://lukhen.com/>&copy; lukhen 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
